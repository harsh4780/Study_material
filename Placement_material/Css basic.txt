		  you insert that tuype you show the all over web page
	.Relative = order depend uppon their actual normal position
		    .left .right .bottom .top

			an element with postition : fixed : is positioned relative to the
			viewport.which means it stay in the same place evrn if the page is
			scrolled.
 				.left .right .bottom .top
			prpoerty are used to position the element
	.absolute
			*An element with position: absolute relative the
			nearest postion ancestor (insted of postioned relative
			the viewport like fixed
			*However, if an absolute position element has no positioned
			ancestor , it uses the document body, and moves along with 
			page scrolling
			*note:: Absolute position elements are moved from the normal flow
				and can overlap the element
	.sticky

	          A stick element toggels bet relative and fixed depending
		 on the scroll postion . it is postined relative until a

			4:10 PM 7/27/2023  **** #3d transform ***
	if we want to work 3d transform that time we need to on the perspective

		***Flex box***
	its a one dimensional layout . it makes it easy to align elements
	on 2D plane is pretty easy to use once ou get familiar with main
	properties
			
steps
	The first step is to set dislay : flex on a "Container" element the "Children"
	to the flex container becomes flex items a set of propeties can be applied to 
	the flex container , and have an effect to all the items as a whole , and a d_
	ifferent set of propeties can be applied to flex items and have their effect on
	the targeted items . Flex items can in turn also be flex containers for the ele
	ments it contains , making it easy to create complex layouts

	
	**all the inside flext container are called flex item
	**Horizital axis called is main axix  and by default element is horizontal
	**VErtical axis  called is cross axis 	
	****container properties***

	flex-direction
		flex-direction are used to defime the  diecrtion
		flex-direction : row   .. items allign in main axis
		flex-direction : column.. items allign in cross axis
	        flex-direction : row-reverse .. items allign in main axis in resverse form
		flex-direction : column-reverse .. items allign in main axis\
	flex-wrap : if we want exactly width fix that time use flex wrap
		    agar viewport ki size decrease ho to they adujust their elemnt
		flex-wrap:wrap  ...
		flex-n0-wrap .. bydefult value
		flex-wrap: wrap-reverse ... the elemet are shift in upword dirdction
	flex-flow its short hand notation it combination of flex direction and flex-wrap
		flex-flow:row  wrap
		
	justify-content: appke main axis ke according item ko align karta hai 
		justify-content : flex-start all vlued start in left side display
		justify-content : flex-end valued start in right side display
		justify-content : center  all element are in center
		justify-content : space-around   .. all the element are separed in equal form
				  		only first and last element are place accordingly the size of div
		
		justify-content  : space-between  all the element containe same space but first div are contain\
				  onlu right sight space and last element containe the left side space
		justify-content  : space-between  all the element containe same space 


	align-item ::  In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. 
		align-itmes:flex-start all vlued top in left side display
		align-itmes:flex-start all vlued bottom in left side disp
		align-itmes  : center  all element are in center in cross-axis
		align-items : streach  all elmemet stech in vertical form
	
	gap: gap are use to space between two or more than two divs

	************* Flex Items properties**************
	The direct child elements of a flex conctainer automatically become flexible(flex) items
	
	order: we want to chage the order....ex we have 4 baox  box 1 ko hum last main dalenge 
	       by default every div order is 0 corresponding the position we can change
	       how to use
		.cl{ order:3}
	flex-grow: by default value is 0 jis box pe apply karenge wo grow ho jayega 
	flex-shrink: are use to control a speed of div
	flex-basis :: are use to define a width of box;



	

	
imp question  
	defference bet 1% and 1vw
	2) how can we add border using shadoos
	3)spred radius ::==
